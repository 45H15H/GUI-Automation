* PyAutoGUI - version 0.9.53
* selenium - version 4.5.0
* beautifulsoup4 - version 4.11.1

## Features

This project has some awesome features over the [_Monkeytype_](https://github.com/45H15H/GUI-Automation/tree/main/monkeytype) project

* Explicitly waits for the timer to start
* Explicitly waits for the page to completely load

## Setup

The requirements for this project are listed above.  
To install these libraries to your local environment run the following installation commands in you terminal;

* `pip3 install pyautogui`
* `pip3 install selenium`
* `pip3 install beautifulsoup4`
* `pip3 install lxml`

You will also need a WebDriver specific for the browser. You can get the WebDriver for Google Chrome [_here_](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). For Microsoft Edge, download the WebDriver from [_here_](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/).

It would be better if you kept the WebDriver executable file in the project folder rather than adding it to the PATH.
